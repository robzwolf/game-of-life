"QKIKSUM7","encyclopediaArticle","2019","","Turing machine","Wikipedia","","","","https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turing_machine&oldid=915459429","A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.The machine operates on an infinite memory tape divided into discrete ""cells"". The machine positions its ""head"" over a cell and ""reads"" or ""scans"" the symbol there. Then, as per the symbol and its present place in a ""finite table"" of user-specified instructions, the machine (i) writes a symbol (e.g., a digit or a letter from a finite alphabet) in the cell (some models allowing symbol erasure or no writing), then (ii) either moves the tape one cell left or right (some models allow no motion, some models move the head), then (iii) (as determined by the observed symbol and the machine's place in the table) either proceeds to a subsequent instruction or halts the computation.The Turing machine was invented in 1936 by Alan Turing, who called it an ""a-machine"" (automatic machine). With this model, Turing was able to answer two questions in the negative: (1) Does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape is ""circular"" (e.g., freezes, or fails to continue its computational task); similarly, (2) does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape ever prints a given symbol. Thus by providing a mathematical description of a very simple device capable of arbitrary computations, he was able to prove properties of computation in general—and in particular, the uncomputability of the Entscheidungsproblem ('decision problem').Thus, Turing machines prove fundamental limitations on the power of mechanical computation. While they can express arbitrary computations, their minimalistic design makes them unsuitable for computation in practice: real-world computers are based on different designs that, unlike Turing machines, use random-access memory. Turing completeness is the ability for a system of instructions to simulate a Turing machine. A programming language that is Turing complete is theoretically capable of expressing all tasks accomplishable by computers; nearly all programming languages are Turing complete if the limitations of finite memory are ignored.","2019-09-13","2019-10-14 10:57:43","2019-10-14 10:57:53","2019-10-14 10:57:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 915459429","","/Users/robbie/Zotero/storage/EBWYEJ93/index.html","","Turing Completeness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe the Maximum Density Still Life problem, introduce the concept of constraint programming, give an overview on how the problem can be modelled and solved with CP, and report on best-known results for the problem.","2010","2019-10-20 19:21:43","2019-10-20 19:21:43","2019-10-20 19:21:43","167-175","","","","","","","","","","","Springer London","London","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-1-84996-217-9_10","","","","","Board Size; Constraint Programming; Constraint Satisfaction Problem; Maximum Density; Stable Pattern","Adamatzky, Andrew","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

LtL was proposed by David Griffeath in the early 1990s to explore whether Life might be a clue to a critical phase point in the threshold-range scaling limit. The LtL family of rules includes Life as well as a rich set of two-dimensional rules, some of which exhibit dynamics vastly different from Life. In this chapter we present rigorous results and conjectures about the ergodic classifications of several sets of “simplified” LtL rules, each of which has a property that makes the rule easier to analyze. For example, these include symmetric rules such as the threshold voter automaton and the anti-voter automaton, monotone rules such as the threshold growth models, and others.

We use Conway's Life automaton as a model, but the idea extends easily to other geometries, dimensions, and number of states.","1984-01-01","2019-10-31 17:29:21","2019-10-31 17:29:21","2019-10-31 17:29:21","75-80","","1","10","","Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/robbie/Zotero/storage/VB6AYTYI/0167278984902513.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

HyperText is a way to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will. It provides a single user-interface to large classes of information (reports, notes, data-bases, computer documentation and on-line help). We propose a simple scheme incorporating servers already available at CERN. The project has two phases: firstly we make use of existing software and hardware as well as implementing simple browsers for the user's workstations, based on an analysis of the requirements for information access needs by experiments. Secondly, we extend the application area by also allowing the users to add new material. Phase one should take 3 months with the full manpower complement, phase two a further 3 months, but this phase is more open-ended, and a review of needs and wishes will be incorporated into it. The manpower required is 4 software engineers and a programmer, (one of which could be a Fellow). Each person works on a specific part (eg. specific platform support). Each person will require a state-of-the-art workstation , but there must be one of each of the supported types. These will cost from 10 to 20k each, totalling 50k. In addition, we would like to use commercially available software as much as possible, and foresee an expense of 30k during development for one-user licences, visits to existing installations and consultancy. We will assume that the project can rely on some computing support at no cost: development file space on existing development systems, installation and system manager support for daemon software.","1990-11-12","2019-10-31 19:10:21","2019-10-31 19:12:24","2019-10-31 19:10:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/robbie/Zotero/storage/SQ33SECP/Proposal.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are a number of commonuse cases where, ideally, the server would like to talk to the clientdashboards and monitoring apps, chat rooms and other collaborations, and progress reports on longrunning processes. Comet (a.k.a. Reverse Ajax) provides a mechanism for enabling this. Comet is moderately complex to implement. But this practical, handson book gets you going. In Part 1 of this book, we start by examining the use cases, and look at the simple alternatives to Comet and how far they can satisfy your needs. In some situations, though, only Comet will do. In Part 2, we demonstrate how to set up and run a Cometbased application. With this book, be a part of the next generation, Ajax 2.0. What youll learn Find out what Comet is and the trouble with HTTP. See how to achieve push, polling, piggybacking, raw sockets, and more. Explore some common use cases and a worked example on magnetic poetry. Understand what some issues and techniques are including the tworequest limit, pubsub and server architectures, and continuations vs. native Comet. Use implementations of Comet, including Cometd/Bayeaux, Reverse Ajax in DWR, and more. Work through the final example using DWR Framework. Who is this book for?

Ajax can help in making a new model, in which the single-page web interface is composed of individual components that can be updated/ replaced independently.

Although AJAX is providing warranted real-time capabilities to the Web, it requires unconventional programming methods at the expense of extensive resource usage. WebSockets, which is an emerging protocol, has the potential to address many challenges with implementing asynchronous communication over the Web. However, there has been no independent study that quantitatively compares AJAX and WebSockets.This paper therefore provides two contributions to integrating Web technologies in real-time systems. First, it provides an experience report for adding real-time monitoring support over the Web to the Open-source Architecture of Software Instrumentation of Systems (OASIS), which is an open-source real-time instrumentation middleware for distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems. Secondly, its quantitatively compares using AJAX and WebSockets to stream collected instrumentation data over the Web. Results from our study show that a WebSockets server consumes 50% less network bandwidth than an AJAX server; a WebSockets client consumes memory at constant rate, not at an increasing rate; and WebSockets can send up to 215.44% more data samples when consuming the same amount network bandwidth as AJAX.","2013-04","2019-10-31 20:49:47","2019-10-31 20:49:47","","110-118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/robbie/Zotero/storage/MMX773TM/6601579.html; /Users/robbie/Zotero/storage/JSSVIGSX/Puranik et al. - 2013 - Real-Time Monitoring using AJAX and WebSockets.pdf","","","Internet; Java; XML; AJAX; asynchronous JavaScript; Bandwidth; distributed real-time systems; DRE systems; embedded systems; Memory management; monitoring; OASIS; open-source architecture; Probes; protocol; protocols; Protocols; public domain software; real-time monitoring; Real-time systems; Software; software architecture; software instrumentation of systems; unconventional programming; WebSockets; World Wide Web","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2013 20th IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Engineering of Computer Based Systems (ECBS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the heart of this new approach lies a single page interaction model that facilitates rich interactivity. Also push-based solutions from the distributed systems are being adopted on the web for ajax applications. The field is, however, characterized by the lack of a coherent and precisely described set of architectural concepts. As a consequence, it is rather difficult to understand, assess, and compare the existing approaches. We have studied and experimented with several ajax frameworks trying to understand their architectural properties. In this paper, we summarize four of these frameworks and examine their properties and introduce the spiar architectural style which captures the essence of ajax applications. We describe the guiding software engineering principles and the constraints chosen to induce the desired properties. The style emphasizes user interface component development, intermediary delta-communication between client/server components, and push-based event notification of state changes through the components, to improve a number of properties such as user interactivity, user-perceived latency, data coherence, and ease of development. In addition, we use the concepts and principles to discuss various open issues in ajax frameworks and application development.","2008-12-01","2019-10-31 21:13:12","2019-10-31 21:13:12","2019-10-31 21:13:12","2194-2209","","12","81","","Journal of Systems and Software","","Best papers from the 2007 Australian Software Engineering Conference (ASWEC 2007), Melbourne, Australia, April 10-13, 2007","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/robbie/Zotero/storage/RL336VDW/Mesbah and van Deursen - 2008 - A component- and push-based architectural style fo.pdf; /Users/robbie/Zotero/storage/SYAW6EEC/S0164121208000769.html","","","Rich internet application; Single page interface; Web architectural style; Web engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
