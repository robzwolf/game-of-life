Abstract

A new breed of web application, dubbed ajax , is emerging in response to a limited degree of interactivity in large-grain stateless Web interactions. At the heart of this new approach lies a single page interaction model that facilitates rich interactivity. Also push-based solutions from the distributed systems are being adopted on the web for ajax applications. The field is, however, characterized by the lack of a coherent and precisely described set of architectural concepts. As a consequence, it is rather difficult to understand, assess, and compare the existing approaches. We have studied and experimented with several ajax frameworks trying to understand their architectural properties. In this paper, we summarize four of these frameworks and examine their properties and introduce the spiar architectural style which captures the essence of ajax applications. We describe the guiding software engineering principles and the constraints chosen to induce the desired properties. The style emphasizes user interface component development, intermediary delta-communication between client/server components, and push-based event notification of state changes through the components, to improve a number of properties such as user interactivity, user-perceived latency, data coherence, and ease of development. In addition, we use the concepts and principles to discuss various open issues in ajax frameworks and application development.

Ali Mesbah received the MSc degree in computer science from Delft University of Technology in 2003. Since 2001, he has worked as a software engineer on different Web-based projects at West Consulting. Currently, he is working as a PhD candidate at the Software Engineering Research Group, Delft University of Technology. His research interests include Ajax-driven web engineering, reverse engineering, and software architecture.

Arie van Deursen is a full professor at Delft University of Technology, where he is heading the Software Engineering Research Group. He obtained his MSc degree in computer science in 1990 from the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, and his PhD degree from the University of Amsterdam in 1994. From 1996 until 2006 he was a research leader at CWI, the Dutch National Institute for Research in Mathematics in Computer Science. His research interests include reverse engineering, program comprehension, and software architecture. He was program chair of the Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE) in 2002 and 2003, and served on numerous program committees in the areas of software evolution, maintenance, and software engineering in general. He is a member of the editorial board of the Empirical Software Engineering journal.
