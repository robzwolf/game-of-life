<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Each third year student reading Single Honours Computer Science is 
required to follow a 40 credit project module. Additionally Natural 
Science students may choose to do their project within Computing.</p>
<p>Projects are inevitably and deliberately very varied in the topic 
they address and in the type of approach required. For example, all 
projects will involve designing and creating a tool or system. However, 
the emphasis in some may be theoretical or mathematical, or the tool or 
system may be used to undertake empirical research. All allow 
opportunity for initiative by the student and are open-ended in that 
they offer scope for considerably more work than can be achieved in the 
available time.</p>
<p>(<a href="#overview">back to overview</a>)</p>


<h2 id="formalities">Formalities</h2>
<p>Your attention is drawn to the following University-wide policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The policy on <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/learningandteaching.handbook/6/2/5/">late hand-in</a> of work.</li>
<li>The policy on <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/learningandteaching.handbook/6/2/4/">plagiarism</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>(<a href="#overview">back to overview</a>)</p>


<h2 id="advice">General Advice</h2>
<h3><span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;">Warning</span></h3>
<p><span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;">Above all, pay 
attention to the following points. Failure to do so in the past has 
resulted in students attaining very poor marks and even failing 
completely. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;">Start early. Put in enough work. If you do not do enough, you will fail. </span></li>
<li><span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;">Conversely, do not 
spend the whole of the Easter vacation on your project at the expense of
 your revision. A double module project represents only one third of 
your final-year assessment, translating into one fifth of your overall 
degree mark. You cannot afford to neglect the other two-thirds of your 
final-year mark.</span></li>
<li><span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;">The writeup and the 
project itself must use and apply Computer Science; it is not sufficient
 to purposelessly produce an implementation. This above all is the major
 weakness of past projects. </span></li>
<li><span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;">Include a high-quality literature survey. </span></li>
<li><span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;">Include RESULTS. A project without results and an evaluation of them is useless. </span></li>
</ul>


<h3>Important Note</h3>
<p>If you get into difficulties with your project work, for example you 
feel you face insurmountable problems, or you feel your progress is 
inadequate, you <b>must</b> contact your supervisor, or the project 
coordinator, or the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Do not take any 
hasty action which you may have cause to regret later. Do <b>not</b> take short cuts, or attempt to disguise the problem in your program or writeup.</p>
<h3>Some Useful Hints</h3>
<p>Each year, the examiners find that some students have lost marks 
quite needlessly in the management and presentation of their projects. 
The following hints are intended as a summary of the ways in which this 
can be avoided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read this document several times during the year and follow its advice.</li>
<li>If you are using your own machine, keep backups. This is your responsibility and no allowance will be made for a lost project.</li>
<li>Make the most of your supervisor's help, by preparing for meetings and asking sensible questions.</li>
<li>Remember that the third-year project represents a substantial piece 
of work, so the examiners will be looking for major progress and 
substantial deliverables. In previous years, examiners have expressed 
concern about the work content of some projects.</li>
<li>Pay adequate attention to the Results section of your work. An implementation with no results is not worth many marks.</li>
<li>Remember that the project paper carries much weight.</li>
<li>Give full details of all your references so that the reader can find
 them for themselves if necessary. Remember that References are papers 
or books that you have explicitly cited in your reports. A Bibliography 
is simply a list of relevant material which may not be cross-referenced.
 You should supply a References section. In general, simply using the 
standard course text-books is not sufficient, nor is just referencing 
material on the web.</li>
<li>Use diagrams in your final paper. "A picture is 
worth a thousand words", and is an important medium for communication. 
Ensure that a key is given for boxes, lines etc. (even professional 
papers often fail to do so).</li>
<li>Do not leave the writing up of the final paper until the 
Easter vacation. It is again too late to receive adequate support from 
your supervisor supervisor. Make a plan for submitting a draft during 
Epiphany term.</li>
<li>Pay due attention to grammar and learn to write in an academic 
style. A common failing in this respect is the use of the first person 
singular (out of place in scientific or technical writing).</li>
<li>Make sure that the reports have a proper academic content.</li>
<li>Do not bore the examiners with excessive unimportant detail - put 
yourself in the shoes of the reader who is not familiar at all with you 
or your project.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use of Students' Computers</h3>
<p>A student may use their own computer for part or all of the practical
 work involved in a project, provided that it is suitable for the 
purpose (as agreed with the supervisor) and that any proprietary 
software used is properly licensed. Note that the University's site 
licenses do not normally cover students' personal computers.</p>
<p>If a personal machine is used, the responsibility for back-ups etc. 
lies entirely with the student. If, for example, a student loses 
programs and/or data and is unable to demonstrate deliverables, <b>no </b>allowance
 will be made. Third-year students are expected to be aware of sensible 
back-up/security procedures on their own equipment. Ignorance or 
carelessness is not acceptable as an excuse.</p>

<h2 id="organisation">Start of the Project</h2>

<h3>Project Specification and Literature Survey</h3>
<p>It is <b>vital </b>to make a strong start and you need to hit the 
ground running at the start of your third year.
</p><p> In the first weeks you must produce a project 
specification, including the different levels of deliverable, in 
consultation with your supervisor. It must be emailed to the supervisor 
by the end of week 4 for them to approve and to give feedback on. It is 
not possible to change 
projects in any way once the third year has started.</p>

<p>By the end of week 4, you must also email your supervisor a 6-page 
literature survey. Your supervisor will give you feedback on it 
afterwards. The survey is intended to kick-start your work, and as a 
precursor to
 the section of your final paper on related work. 
 There is no prescribed template for the literature survey, but advice 
on producing a 
good literature survey is given <a href="#survey"> here</a>.</p>

<p> A good book for general reading on student research projects
 is <i>The Management of a Student Research Project</i> by Howard, Sharp and Peters (<a href="http://library.dur.ac.uk/search%7ES1?/ahoward/ahoward/151%2C303%2C1022%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=ahoward+keith+1931&amp;3%2C%2C4/indexsort=-">library copies</a>). It covers projects to the Ph.D. level but contains much useful advice for undergraduates also.</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="course">Project Workshops</h2>
<p>This is a short course of workshops on final year projects. The aim 
is to separate the administrative issues - common to all projects - from
 the academic ones - the preserve of the supervisor. Information on 
workshops, including a timetable, will be published on duo.</p>
<p>(<a href="#overview">back to overview</a>)</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="supervision">Supervision</h2>
<p>The following guidelines are based on the report, Academic Standards 
in Universities, published by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and 
Principals (1986):</p>
<h3>Responsibilities of the Supervisor</h3>
<ol>
<li>to give guidance about the nature of the project and the standard 
expected, about the planning of the project, about literature and 
sources, about techniques and methods and about any problems of 
plagiarism;</li>
<li>to maintain contact via regular tutorial meetings;</li>
<li>to be accessible within reason at other times for giving advice to the student;</li>
<li>to give detailed advice on milestones;</li>
<li>to request written work as appropriate and return such work with constructive criticism within a reasonable time;</li>
<li>to ensure that a student is made aware of any inadequacy of progress, or of standards of work below those expected;</li>
<li>to encourage the student to produce an early draft of the final paper,
 to comment on such a draft critically and return the comments promptly. If the 
student does not do so, this is the student's responsibility.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Responsibilities of the Student</h3>
<ol>
<li>to agree on a schedule of meetings with the supervisor and to attend such meetings;</li>
<li>to take the initiative in raising problems, however elementary they may seem;</li>
<li>to maintain the progress of the work in accordance with the milestones and objectives agreed with the supervisor;</li>
<li>to contribute to planning the project and monitoring progress against the plan;</li>
<li>to keep a project log for recording results, ideas, references etc. acquired as the project progresses;</li>
<li>to determine the contents of the reports and of oral presentations;</li>
<li>to submit a draft of the final paper to the supervisor two weeks before the summative deadline.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><i> In summary, the management of the project and the course that it takes, are ultimately the responsibility of the student</i></b>.</p>
<h3>Documentation and Project Log Book</h3>
<p>Each time student and supervisor meet, it is the supervisor's 
responsibility to ensure that a written record of the meeting is 
produced. The student and the supervisor each take a copy and the 
student must file it in the Project Log. The Project Log should also be 
used to keep informal working notes for the project. It can be a 
loose-leaf or firm-bound A4-sized diary, or, if preferred, it can be 
electronic (if it is electronic but the supervisor produces a 
handwritten note of each meeting, then it is the responsibility of the 
student to scan this note).</p>
<p>The Project Log must be handed in at the Project Oral examination (if
 electronic you must use some suitably portable medium). The log is not 
assessed directly. However, it provides evidence of progress when 
students have fallen ill, and provides evidence to support the 
conclusions in the final project writeup.</p>
<p>The main function of the log during the year is to act as your work 
book diary. References to, and summaries of, useful papers should be 
kept in it (you do not want to spend time 4 months later re-reading all 
your papers when you write up the writeup). Important design ideas, 
results, measurements etc. should also be kept in the log. The log will 
be made available to all the examiners of your project.</p>
<p>(<a href="#overview">back to overview</a>)</p>
<hr>


<h2 id="assessment">Tasks and Deliverables</h2>
<p>The project includes the following milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#survey">Literature Survey:</a> a formative piece of work to be done by Week 4.</li>
<li><a href="#plan">Project Plan: </a> a formative exercise to be done by Week 4.</li>
<li><a href="#presentation">Oral Presentation:</a> a <span><span>summative</span></span>  exercise worth 10 per cent of the total mark undertaken in Week 13.</li>
<li><a href="#demonstration">Preliminary Demonstration:</a> a formative exercise to be done with supervisors no later than the end of Week 14.</li>
<li><a href="#report">Final Paper:</a> a <span><span>summative</span></span> exercise worth 55 per cent of the total mark to be submitted in Week 21.</li>
<li><a href="#software">Software Demonstration:</a> a <span><span>summative</span></span>  exercise worth 30 per cent of the total mark undertaken in Week 22.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be a workshop devoted to each of these. For <span><span>summative</span></span> assessments, <span><span>marksheets</span></span> will be provided detailing the assessment criteria.</p>
<p>Students' project management skills are assessed by their supervisor who awards a mark worth 5 per cent of the total mark.</p>
<p>Each of the tasks is described below. First some general remarks.</p>
<p>There are two people involved in the assessment of project work 
(except for the project management mark), reflecting its importance in 
the overall final Degree mark. For the Final Paper and 
Software Demonstration, one of these is the supervisor. All written 
project work will also be looked at by an External Examiner from outside
 the University. Any differences between marks awarded by the various 
examiners will be investigated and resolved with meticulous care by the 
Board of Examiners.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of the project is to allow the student to 
exercise the skills, knowledge, approach and critical faculties acquired
 in the first two years of study. The application of these attributes 
must be clearly visible in the project. A common cause of criticism by 
examiners of project work is that the student has not incorporated work 
and approaches from previous years and that the task has become simply 
an implementation. However large an implementation, this type of project
 work will receive very low marks. The writeup should be an academic 
writeup, not a product description nor a piece of journalism and must 
conform to the Final Paper Template. A critical approach must be clearly
 evident; full use of material from earlier years must be achieved. Top 
priority must be given to establishing the academic context of the 
project, and showing to its relation to other work in the field.</p>
<p>A good project will include:</p>
<ol>
<li>excellent progress against objectives (i.e. hard work);</li>
<li>a major contribution from the student in <span><span>organising</span></span> and managing the project;</li>
<li>clear evidence of application of knowledge, skills, approach and 
critical faculties from the rest of the course (this is the single most 
important criterion);</li>
<li>an excellent literature review and exposition of the academic context;</li>
<li>a deliverable of good quality and full presentation of results;</li>
<li>the display of good communication skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>Third-year projects are not research projects, in that there is no 
obligation (as in a Ph.D.) to produce original work. There will, 
however, be scope in all projects for innovation and enterprise by the 
student.</p>
<p>(<a href="#overview">back to overview</a>)</p>
<hr>


<h2 id="survey">Literature Survey</h2>
<p>The aims of the literature survey are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>to show that you can do a proper literature survey (an important skill)</li>
<li>to determine the state of the art in project areas</li>
<li>to acquire a set of useful techniques/methods/algorithms to make a strong start.</li>
</ol>
<p>The literature survey, possibly extended/modified, will be included in the Final Paper.</p>
<h3>Guidelines for the Literature Survey</h3>
<p><b>How not to do it.</b></p>
<p>Do not simply list each book or paper you have read with a precise of it.</p>
<p><b>How to do it.</b></p>
<p>Typically the first page is used to define your terms and to give 
references to where you found the definition. For example, on a project 
on safety critical systems, it would be essential to define very 
carefully `safety critical systems' and other terms such as `safety', 
`reliability', `error free' and so on.</p>
<p>The next four pages should be used to select some themes. If your project was about compiler parsers, good themes might be:</p>
<ol>
<li>parsing algorithms</li>
<li>tools</li>
<li>language classification.</li>
</ol>
<p>You then give a succinct, careful description of each of these as if 
you were addressing an experienced computer scientist who was not an 
expert in the area. As your description develops cite references to 
books/papers where you found the information.</p>
<p>Finally use the last page to assess the themes, draw some conclusions and show how you will use it in your project.</p>
<p><b>Why do a literature survey?</b></p>
<p>For reuse. There is not point in reinventing wheels. Find out what has been done before and use it. But it is <b>essential</b> to quote your sources.</p>
<p><b>How many papers/books?</b></p>
<p>Typically, this will be around 15-25.</p>
<p><b>Is this important?</b></p>
<p>Yes, very. External Examiners place great stress on it.</p>
<p>(<a href="#overview">back to overview</a>)</p>
<hr>


<h2 id="plan">Project Plan</h2>
<p>The third-year project will probably be the first major piece of 
individual work that you have undertaken and the proper management of it
 is essential for success. Thus, it is necessary to pay full attention 
to planning the project. It is fair to say that a first-class project 
does not derive only from technical flair; other important ingredients 
are good management and <span><span>organisation</span></span>.</p>
<p>Management of the project is the responsibility of the student; 
however, the student should seek, and take advantage of, the advice of 
their supervisor in this task. Management involves two main tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>preparing a plan;</li>
<li>monitoring progress against the plan.</li>
</ol>
<p>A plan may be changed if circumstances require it. However, a project
 without any plan stands little chance of success. Students typically 
become very enthusiastic about their projects and strongly committed to 
them. This is of course very welcome but the time spent on the project 
should allow adequate attention to be paid to the remaining parts of the
 course. It should be remembered that the project contributes an 
important, but not the dominant share of the degree mark and a good 
class of degree can only be achieved by good performance in the 
examinations as well as in the project.</p>
<p>You should expect, over the course of the third year, to allocate 
roughly 12 hours per week to a double module project. The time you have 
available each week might vary, but you should bear in mind this 
expected workload.</p>
<p>In planning your work, and in discussion with your supervisor, you 
should be careful to identify basic, intermediate and advanced 
deliverables, intended to fulfill the corresponding objectives in the 
original project proposal. Occasionally, adverse circumstances, or the 
results of your initial investigations, mean that your deliverables need
 to be revised. This should be done only in consultation with, and with 
the approval of, your supervisor.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>A maximum of 2 pages that gives a one-page outline of the project 
together with a one-page plan, which includes a Gantt chart. The idea of this report is to 
focus your mind on the objectives and plan; commitment to a particular 
course of investigation at this stage makes it possible to ensure that 
the necessary tools, software etc. are available.</p>
<p>(<a href="#overview">back to overview</a>)</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="presentation">Oral Presentation</h2>
<p>At several points in your degree course, you will have to give a 
presentation to staff and fellow students. This can be nerve-wracking if
 you have not had any experience of it before hand. However, whatever 
profession you enter after graduation, you will have to stand on your 
feet regularly and present material to an audience. Now is the time to 
gain some experience.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>Presentations take place in university teaching rooms and student 
must prepare a presentation to be delivered using a data projector. 
(Details of suitable file types and available software will be provided 
nearer the time). Students are assessed on their presentation skills (<b>not</b> on the progress of their project). More details of the assessment criteria will be provided in a workshop.</p>
<h3>Some tips on giving talks</h3>
<p>The basic strategy is <b>good planning</b> followed by <b>practice</b>. Here are some suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The old IBM style of 'say what you are going to say; say it; and 
then say what you have just said' is still useful advice in structuring a
 talk.</li>
<li>Try to avoid reading from notes. This can be a useful technique to 
start off and get over initial nerves. After that, use summary cards or 
key notes.</li>
<li>Don't read out what is on the slides -- the audience can do that for
 themselves, use the material on the slides to underpin your 
explanations.</li>
<li>Practice your talk beforehand, if necessary with your friendly bathroom mirror.</li>
<li>Ensure that all the visual aids you needs are there in the room and that they work. Make sure you do not trip over wires.</li>
<li>If you run out of time, do not try to speak twice as fast. Produce a
 brief, succinct summary of what you were going to say and invite those 
interested in the detail to contact you later.</li>
<li>About 9 lines of 24 point type is about as much as you can get on a 
slide. Make the most of diagrams and visuals ("a picture is worth 1000 
words"). <b>DO NOT</b> simply put normal A4 typescript onto a 
slide.&nbsp; &nbsp; (As a very rough rule of thumb, allow about 2 
minutes per slide, so if you have (say) ten minutes, don't have more 
than 5/6 slides.)</li>
<li>Time is allocated for questions, so you should prepare for the 
obvious ones. If you can not answer the question asked, answer one you 
can (politicians are good at this).</li>
<li>Think carefully about your audience. For example, if you are going 
to give a talk on a Haskell project, will all the audience have a 
suitable knowledge? Will you have to spend a little time presenting the 
background?
<p>In general, it is much better to assume that an audience know too little than too much.</p>
</li>
<li>The talk is intended to be a stand-alone presentation, and therefore
 should be regarded as independent of any preceding talks. If, for 
example, a preceding talk is on the same project as yours, you must 
nonetheless give (your version of) the same background material.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a number of books available on giving talks. See also:</p>
<p>S.L. Peyton-Jones, J. Hughes &amp; J. <span><span>Launchbury</span></span>, <b>How to give a good research talk</b>, ACM SIGPLAN Notices, Vol 28, No 11, Nov 1993, pp 9-12.</p>
<p><br> (<a href="#overview">back to overview</a>)</p>
<hr>


<h2 id="demonstration">Preliminary Demonstration</h2>
<p>By the end of Week 14, each student will be asked, during a usual 
supervisory meeting, to demonstrate what has been achieved so far out of
 the list of deliverables promised. The idea behind this is that 
significant progress and results should by now be evident.</p>
<p>The demonstration is for formative assessment only, and does not contribute towards the <span><span>summative</span></span>
 assessment. The supervisor will note that a satisfactory demonstration 
has been completed in the written note for the meeting, or contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies if there is not
 sufficient evidence of progress.</p>
<p>(<a href="#overview">back to overview</a>)</p>
<hr>


<h2 id="report">Final Paper</h2>
<h3>General Remarks</h3>
<p>The project write up will be in the form of an academic paper and 
will be written to conform to the Final Paper template described in the 
Project Workshops. However epoch-making the project may be considered to
 be by the student, marks will be awarded only on the evidence available
 to examiners, in particular the writeup. The&nbsp; <span><span>organisation</span></span>,
 style etc. will be discussed with in the Project Workshops. Generally, 
the first part of the writeup should be aimed at an "all-round" Computer
 Scientist and not an expert in the area. The External Examiner may not 
have <span><span>specialised</span></span> knowledge of the area.</p>
<p>Supervisors will be willing to give advice on a draft,
 provided that this draft is submitted in good time. Please note that 
supervisors are likely to be working on their own research during 
vacations, so a draft should be submitted during term-time only. There is
 no obligation on the supervisor to read drafts in student vacation 
time.</p>
<p><a name="format"></a></p>
<h3>Writeup Style</h3>
<p>In their second year, undergraduates will have undertaken a Software 
Engineering project which required substantial documentation. It is 
important to stress that the third-year project calls for a very 
different approach and style; it is an academic writeup, not a product 
manual. Nor should it be a diary of how the project developed.</p>
<p>A useful piece of advice is to avoid turgid detailed descriptions of 
technical problems. Concentrate on the essentials, the motivation, 
theory, rationale and discussion of options. The writeup should have a 
clear "message" to give. Pay adequate attention to results.</p>
<p><a name="submission"></a></p>
<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>Submission must be <span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;">no later than 2pm on Friday, Week 21, in the Easter Term</span>. Late <span><span>writeups</span></span>
 will not be accepted unless accompanied by a medical certificate. In 
particular, machine or word-processing problems will not be accepted as 
an excuse for lateness. Students should therefore bear in mind that 
printers as well as CPUs are liable to fail when most urgently needed, 
and that intensive use of the printers will create a bottleneck. If a 
project is handed in late the <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/learningandteaching.handbook/6/2/5/">University-wide scheme for late work</a> will be applied.</p>
<p>Production of the Final Paper is the responsibility of the student. <span><span>Writeups</span></span> must conform to the Final Paper Template provided.</p>
<p>(<a href="#overview">back to overview</a>)</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="software">Software Demonstration</h2>
<p>During Week 22, an oral examination will be 
held during which the software and any other deliverables resulting from
 the project must be demonstrated to the examiners, who may well be 
non-specialists as far as your field of <span><span>enquiry</span></span>
 is concerned. This is prior to their reading the final writeup, so care
 should be taken to place your work in an appropriate context for them. 
Generally, University computers should be used for the demonstration, 
but where this is not possible, agreement should be sought in advance 
with the examiners concerned. The assessment criteria will be given in a
 workshop.</p>
<p>The software which you have written should be submitted 
electronically at the same time as the Final Paper. Note that the 
assessment of the software will be based on the demonstration given 
during the oral examination and the submitted work will only be viewed 
if the examiners feel further <span><span>enquiry</span></span> is necessary (<span><span>eg</span></span>. in the case of suspected plagiarism).</p>
<p>Students are reminded that software produced as part of your degree 
course (including project work) is the property of the University. 
However, the University's policy is to share rewards with those 
involved; see Academic work with commercial potential in the <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/university.calendar/volumei/general_regulations/intellectual_property_rights/">General Regulations</a>.</p>
