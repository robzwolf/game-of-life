Introduction

Each third year student reading Single Honours Computer Science is required to follow a 40 credit project module. Additionally Natural Science students may choose to do their project within Computing.

Projects are inevitably and deliberately very varied in the topic they address and in the type of approach required. For example, all projects will involve designing and creating a tool or system. However, the emphasis in some may be theoretical or mathematical, or the tool or system may be used to undertake empirical research. All allow opportunity for initiative by the student and are open-ended in that they offer scope for considerably more work than can be achieved in the available time.

Formalities

Your attention is drawn to the following University-wide policies:

    The policy on late hand-in of work.
    The policy on plagiarism .

General Advice
Warning

Above all, pay attention to the following points. Failure to do so in the past has resulted in students attaining very poor marks and even failing completely.

    Start early. Put in enough work. If you do not do enough, you will fail.
    Conversely, do not spend the whole of the Easter vacation on your project at the expense of your revision. A double module project represents only one third of your final-year assessment, translating into one fifth of your overall degree mark. You cannot afford to neglect the other two-thirds of your final-year mark.
    The writeup and the project itself must use and apply Computer Science; it is not sufficient to purposelessly produce an implementation. This above all is the major weakness of past projects.
    Include a high-quality literature survey.
    Include RESULTS. A project without results and an evaluation of them is useless.

Important Note

If you get into difficulties with your project work, for example you feel you face insurmountable problems, or you feel your progress is inadequate, you must contact your supervisor, or the project coordinator, or the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Do not take any hasty action which you may have cause to regret later. Do not take short cuts, or attempt to disguise the problem in your program or writeup.
Some Useful Hints

Each year, the examiners find that some students have lost marks quite needlessly in the management and presentation of their projects. The following hints are intended as a summary of the ways in which this can be avoided:

    Read this document several times during the year and follow its advice.
    If you are using your own machine, keep backups. This is your responsibility and no allowance will be made for a lost project.
    Make the most of your supervisor's help, by preparing for meetings and asking sensible questions.
    Remember that the third-year project represents a substantial piece of work, so the examiners will be looking for major progress and substantial deliverables. In previous years, examiners have expressed concern about the work content of some projects.
    Pay adequate attention to the Results section of your work. An implementation with no results is not worth many marks.
    Remember that the project paper carries much weight.
    Give full details of all your references so that the reader can find them for themselves if necessary. Remember that References are papers or books that you have explicitly cited in your reports. A Bibliography is simply a list of relevant material which may not be cross-referenced. You should supply a References section. In general, simply using the standard course text-books is not sufficient, nor is just referencing material on the web.
    Use diagrams in your final paper. "A picture is worth a thousand words", and is an important medium for communication. Ensure that a key is given for boxes, lines etc. (even professional papers often fail to do so).
    Do not leave the writing up of the final paper until the Easter vacation. It is again too late to receive adequate support from your supervisor supervisor. Make a plan for submitting a draft during Epiphany term.
    Pay due attention to grammar and learn to write in an academic style. A common failing in this respect is the use of the first person singular (out of place in scientific or technical writing).
    Make sure that the reports have a proper academic content.
    Do not bore the examiners with excessive unimportant detail - put yourself in the shoes of the reader who is not familiar at all with you or your project.

Use of Students' Computers

A student may use their own computer for part or all of the practical work involved in a project, provided that it is suitable for the purpose (as agreed with the supervisor) and that any proprietary software used is properly licensed. Note that the University's site licenses do not normally cover students' personal computers.

If a personal machine is used, the responsibility for back-ups etc. lies entirely with the student. If, for example, a student loses programs and/or data and is unable to demonstrate deliverables, no allowance will be made. Third-year students are expected to be aware of sensible back-up/security procedures on their own equipment. Ignorance or carelessness is not acceptable as an excuse.

Start of the Project
Project Specification and Literature Survey

It is vital to make a strong start and you need to hit the ground running at the start of your third year.

In the first weeks you must produce a project specification, including the different levels of deliverable, in consultation with your supervisor. It must be emailed to the supervisor by the end of week 4 for them to approve and to give feedback on. It is not possible to change projects in any way once the third year has started.

By the end of week 4, you must also email your supervisor a 6-page literature survey. Your supervisor will give you feedback on it afterwards. The survey is intended to kick-start your work, and as a precursor to the section of your final paper on related work. There is no prescribed template for the literature survey, but advice on producing a good literature survey is given here .

A good book for general reading on student research projects is The Management of a Student Research Project by Howard, Sharp and Peters ( library copies ). It covers projects to the Ph.D. level but contains much useful advice for undergraduates also.
Project Workshops

This is a short course of workshops on final year projects. The aim is to separate the administrative issues - common to all projects - from the academic ones - the preserve of the supervisor. Information on workshops, including a timetable, will be published on duo.

( back to overview )
Supervision

The following guidelines are based on the report, Academic Standards in Universities, published by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals (1986):
Responsibilities of the Supervisor

    to give guidance about the nature of the project and the standard expected, about the planning of the project, about literature and sources, about techniques and methods and about any problems of plagiarism;
    to maintain contact via regular tutorial meetings;
    to be accessible within reason at other times for giving advice to the student;
    to give detailed advice on milestones;
    to request written work as appropriate and return such work with constructive criticism within a reasonable time;
    to ensure that a student is made aware of any inadequacy of progress, or of standards of work below those expected;
    to encourage the student to produce an early draft of the final paper, to comment on such a draft critically and return the comments promptly. If the student does not do so, this is the student's responsibility.

Responsibilities of the Student

    to agree on a schedule of meetings with the supervisor and to attend such meetings;
    to take the initiative in raising problems, however elementary they may seem;
    to maintain the progress of the work in accordance with the milestones and objectives agreed with the supervisor;
    to contribute to planning the project and monitoring progress against the plan;
    to keep a project log for recording results, ideas, references etc. acquired as the project progresses;
    to determine the contents of the reports and of oral presentations;
    to submit a draft of the final paper to the supervisor two weeks before the summative deadline.

In summary, the management of the project and the course that it takes, are ultimately the responsibility of the student .
Documentation and Project Log Book

Each time student and supervisor meet, it is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure that a written record of the meeting is produced. The student and the supervisor each take a copy and the student must file it in the Project Log. The Project Log should also be used to keep informal working notes for the project. It can be a loose-leaf or firm-bound A4-sized diary, or, if preferred, it can be electronic (if it is electronic but the supervisor produces a handwritten note of each meeting, then it is the responsibility of the student to scan this note).

The Project Log must be handed in at the Project Oral examination (if electronic you must use some suitably portable medium). The log is not assessed directly. However, it provides evidence of progress when students have fallen ill, and provides evidence to support the conclusions in the final project writeup.

The main function of the log during the year is to act as your work book diary. References to, and summaries of, useful papers should be kept in it (you do not want to spend time 4 months later re-reading all your papers when you write up the writeup). Important design ideas, results, measurements etc. should also be kept in the log. The log will be made available to all the examiners of your project.

Tasks and Deliverables

The project includes the following milestones:

    Literature Survey: a formative piece of work to be done by Week 4.
    Project Plan: a formative exercise to be done by Week 4.
    Oral Presentation: a summative exercise worth 10 per cent of the total mark undertaken in Week 13.
    Preliminary Demonstration: a formative exercise to be done with supervisors no later than the end of Week 14.
    Final Paper: a summative exercise worth 55 per cent of the total mark to be submitted in Week 21.
    Software Demonstration: a summative exercise worth 30 per cent of the total mark undertaken in Week 22.

There will be a workshop devoted to each of these. For summative assessments, marksheets will be provided detailing the assessment criteria.

Students' project management skills are assessed by their supervisor who awards a mark worth 5 per cent of the total mark.

Each of the tasks is described below. First some general remarks.

There are two people involved in the assessment of project work (except for the project management mark), reflecting its importance in the overall final Degree mark. For the Final Paper and Software Demonstration, one of these is the supervisor. All written project work will also be looked at by an External Examiner from outside the University. Any differences between marks awarded by the various examiners will be investigated and resolved with meticulous care by the Board of Examiners.

One of the objectives of the project is to allow the student to exercise the skills, knowledge, approach and critical faculties acquired in the first two years of study. The application of these attributes must be clearly visible in the project. A common cause of criticism by examiners of project work is that the student has not incorporated work and approaches from previous years and that the task has become simply an implementation. However large an implementation, this type of project work will receive very low marks. The writeup should be an academic writeup, not a product description nor a piece of journalism and must conform to the Final Paper Template. A critical approach must be clearly evident; full use of material from earlier years must be achieved. Top priority must be given to establishing the academic context of the project, and showing to its relation to other work in the field.

A good project will include:

    excellent progress against objectives (i.e. hard work);
    a major contribution from the student in organising and managing the project;
    clear evidence of application of knowledge, skills, approach and critical faculties from the rest of the course (this is the single most important criterion);
    an excellent literature review and exposition of the academic context;
    a deliverable of good quality and full presentation of results;
    the display of good communication skills.

Third-year projects are not research projects, in that there is no obligation (as in a Ph.D.) to produce original work. There will, however, be scope in all projects for innovation and enterprise by the student.

( back to overview )
Literature Survey

The aims of the literature survey are as follows:

    to show that you can do a proper literature survey (an important skill)
    to determine the state of the art in project areas
    to acquire a set of useful techniques/methods/algorithms to make a strong start.

The literature survey, possibly extended/modified, will be included in the Final Paper.
Guidelines for the Literature Survey

How not to do it.

Do not simply list each book or paper you have read with a precise of it.

How to do it.

Typically the first page is used to define your terms and to give references to where you found the definition. For example, on a project on safety critical systems, it would be essential to define very carefully `safety critical systems' and other terms such as `safety', `reliability', `error free' and so on.

The next four pages should be used to select some themes. If your project was about compiler parsers, good themes might be:

    parsing algorithms
    tools
    language classification.

You then give a succinct, careful description of each of these as if you were addressing an experienced computer scientist who was not an expert in the area. As your description develops cite references to books/papers where you found the information.

Finally use the last page to assess the themes, draw some conclusions and show how you will use it in your project.

Why do a literature survey?

For reuse. There is not point in reinventing wheels. Find out what has been done before and use it. But it is essential to quote your sources.

How many papers/books?

Typically, this will be around 15-25.

Is this important?

Yes, very. External Examiners place great stress on it.

( back to overview )
Project Plan

The third-year project will probably be the first major piece of individual work that you have undertaken and the proper management of it is essential for success. Thus, it is necessary to pay full attention to planning the project. It is fair to say that a first-class project does not derive only from technical flair; other important ingredients are good management and organisation .

Management of the project is the responsibility of the student; however, the student should seek, and take advantage of, the advice of their supervisor in this task. Management involves two main tasks:

    preparing a plan;
    monitoring progress against the plan.

A plan may be changed if circumstances require it. However, a project without any plan stands little chance of success. Students typically become very enthusiastic about their projects and strongly committed to them. This is of course very welcome but the time spent on the project should allow adequate attention to be paid to the remaining parts of the course. It should be remembered that the project contributes an important, but not the dominant share of the degree mark and a good class of degree can only be achieved by good performance in the examinations as well as in the project.

You should expect, over the course of the third year, to allocate roughly 12 hours per week to a double module project. The time you have available each week might vary, but you should bear in mind this expected workload.

In planning your work, and in discussion with your supervisor, you should be careful to identify basic, intermediate and advanced deliverables, intended to fulfill the corresponding objectives in the original project proposal. Occasionally, adverse circumstances, or the results of your initial investigations, mean that your deliverables need to be revised. This should be done only in consultation with, and with the approval of, your supervisor.
Format

A maximum of 2 pages that gives a one-page outline of the project together with a one-page plan, which includes a Gantt chart. The idea of this report is to focus your mind on the objectives and plan; commitment to a particular course of investigation at this stage makes it possible to ensure that the necessary tools, software etc. are available.

( back to overview )
Oral Presentation

At several points in your degree course, you will have to give a presentation to staff and fellow students. This can be nerve-wracking if you have not had any experience of it before hand. However, whatever profession you enter after graduation, you will have to stand on your feet regularly and present material to an audience. Now is the time to gain some experience.
Format

Presentations take place in university teaching rooms and student must prepare a presentation to be delivered using a data projector. (Details of suitable file types and available software will be provided nearer the time). Students are assessed on their presentation skills ( not on the progress of their project). More details of the assessment criteria will be provided in a workshop.
Some tips on giving talks

The basic strategy is good planning followed by practice . Here are some suggestions:

    The old IBM style of 'say what you are going to say; say it; and then say what you have just said' is still useful advice in structuring a talk.
    Try to avoid reading from notes. This can be a useful technique to start off and get over initial nerves. After that, use summary cards or key notes.
    Don't read out what is on the slides -- the audience can do that for themselves, use the material on the slides to underpin your explanations.
    Practice your talk beforehand, if necessary with your friendly bathroom mirror.
    Ensure that all the visual aids you needs are there in the room and that they work. Make sure you do not trip over wires.
    If you run out of time, do not try to speak twice as fast. Produce a brief, succinct summary of what you were going to say and invite those interested in the detail to contact you later.
    About 9 lines of 24 point type is about as much as you can get on a slide. Make the most of diagrams and visuals ("a picture is worth 1000 words"). DO NOT simply put normal A4 typescript onto a slide.    (As a very rough rule of thumb, allow about 2 minutes per slide, so if you have (say) ten minutes, don't have more than 5/6 slides.)
    Time is allocated for questions, so you should prepare for the obvious ones. If you can not answer the question asked, answer one you can (politicians are good at this).
    Think carefully about your audience. For example, if you are going to give a talk on a Haskell project, will all the audience have a suitable knowledge? Will you have to spend a little time presenting the background?

    In general, it is much better to assume that an audience know too little than too much.
    The talk is intended to be a stand-alone presentation, and therefore should be regarded as independent of any preceding talks. If, for example, a preceding talk is on the same project as yours, you must nonetheless give (your version of) the same background material.

There are a number of books available on giving talks. See also:

S.L. Peyton-Jones, J. Hughes & J. Launchbury , How to give a good research talk , ACM SIGPLAN Notices, Vol 28, No 11, Nov 1993, pp 9-12.


( back to overview )
Preliminary Demonstration

By the end of Week 14, each student will be asked, during a usual supervisory meeting, to demonstrate what has been achieved so far out of the list of deliverables promised. The idea behind this is that significant progress and results should by now be evident.

The demonstration is for formative assessment only, and does not contribute towards the summative assessment. The supervisor will note that a satisfactory demonstration has been completed in the written note for the meeting, or contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies if there is not sufficient evidence of progress.

( back to overview )
Final Paper
General Remarks

The project write up will be in the form of an academic paper and will be written to conform to the Final Paper template described in the Project Workshops. However epoch-making the project may be considered to be by the student, marks will be awarded only on the evidence available to examiners, in particular the writeup. The  organisation , style etc. will be discussed with in the Project Workshops. Generally, the first part of the writeup should be aimed at an "all-round" Computer Scientist and not an expert in the area. The External Examiner may not have specialised knowledge of the area.

Supervisors will be willing to give advice on a draft, provided that this draft is submitted in good time. Please note that supervisors are likely to be working on their own research during vacations, so a draft should be submitted during term-time only. There is no obligation on the supervisor to read drafts in student vacation time.

Writeup Style

In their second year, undergraduates will have undertaken a Software Engineering project which required substantial documentation. It is important to stress that the third-year project calls for a very different approach and style; it is an academic writeup, not a product manual. Nor should it be a diary of how the project developed.

A useful piece of advice is to avoid turgid detailed descriptions of technical problems. Concentrate on the essentials, the motivation, theory, rationale and discussion of options. The writeup should have a clear "message" to give. Pay adequate attention to results.

Submission

Submission must be no later than 2pm on Friday, Week 21, in the Easter Term . Late writeups will not be accepted unless accompanied by a medical certificate. In particular, machine or word-processing problems will not be accepted as an excuse for lateness. Students should therefore bear in mind that printers as well as CPUs are liable to fail when most urgently needed, and that intensive use of the printers will create a bottleneck. If a project is handed in late the University-wide scheme for late work will be applied.

Production of the Final Paper is the responsibility of the student. Writeups must conform to the Final Paper Template provided.

( back to overview )
Software Demonstration

During Week 22, an oral examination will be held during which the software and any other deliverables resulting from the project must be demonstrated to the examiners, who may well be non-specialists as far as your field of enquiry is concerned. This is prior to their reading the final writeup, so care should be taken to place your work in an appropriate context for them. Generally, University computers should be used for the demonstration, but where this is not possible, agreement should be sought in advance with the examiners concerned. The assessment criteria will be given in a workshop.

The software which you have written should be submitted electronically at the same time as the Final Paper. Note that the assessment of the software will be based on the demonstration given during the oral examination and the submitted work will only be viewed if the examiners feel further enquiry is necessary ( eg . in the case of suspected plagiarism).

Students are reminded that software produced as part of your degree course (including project work) is the property of the University. However, the University's policy is to share rewards with those involved; see Academic work with commercial potential in the General Regulations .
