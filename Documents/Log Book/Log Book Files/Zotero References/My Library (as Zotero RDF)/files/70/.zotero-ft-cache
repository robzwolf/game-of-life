Platform 	Cross-platform

Golly is an open-source, cross-platform tool for simulating Conway's Game of Life that was written by Andrew Trevorrow and Tomas Rokicki , with contributions by Dave Greene , Jason Summers , Tim Hutton, Maks Verver, Robert Munafo and Chris Rowett . It contains support for many different types of cellular automaton rules and provides implementations of many different algorithms for evolving those rules. It is fast enough to implement many small patterns via unit cells quickly on current hardware.

In addition to simulating cellular automata, Golly contains libraries that allows it to interact with Lua and Python scripts, allowing it to perform various other tasks as well. For example, some of the scripts included with it allow it to produce simple animated GIFs of patterns, display population graphs, and calculate the density of the current pattern.

Golly is also one of the few Life simulation programs that supports a visual Hashlife mode, allowing for the simulation of huge patterns in very little time. As a result, it is one of the only programs (if not the only program) capable of simulating meta-patterns via the OTCA metapixel efficiently. Several such meta-patterns come packaged with Golly.

Its logo is Kok's galaxy .
