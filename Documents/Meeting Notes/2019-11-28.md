# Project Meeting 28/11/2019

Robbie and Steven

## Questions
- What's an appropriate timeline for work? By when should I aim to have basic, intermediate, advanced objectives completed by?


- Is it better to architect things well from the beginning to avoid having to rewrite components later on, or to focus on getting _something_ built ASAP?


- The presentation is in January, what do I need to have completed and prepared by then?
