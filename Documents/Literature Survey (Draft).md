### Definitions
We need to define the following to enable us to complete the literature survey:

- [Conway's `Game of Life`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- What `at scale` could mean, in the sense of simulating the Game of Life in the browser
- What `performant` could mean, in the sense of simulating the Game of Life in the browser

### Existing Implementations
Summary of existing implementations out there on the web – doing a simple Google search for `game of life implementation` or similar is probably a great way to start this.
