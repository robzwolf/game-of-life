# Literature Survey (Draft)
by [Robbie Jakob-Whitworth](https://robbie.xyz), L3 [Natural Sciences](https://www.dur.ac.uk/natural.sciences/) at [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/).

_This document is still very much a draft, and at this stage is more an outline of what this document will eventually look like._

## Sections
### Definitions
We need to define the following to enable us to complete the literature survey:

- [Conway's `Game of Life`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- What `at scale` could mean, in the sense of simulating the Game of Life in the browser
- What `performant` could mean, in the sense of simulating the Game of Life in the browser
- `Turing machine` / what it means to be `Turing complete`, as an aside (this is not particularly relevant to the core content of this project)

### Existing Implementations
Summary of existing implementations out there on the web – doing a simple Google search for `game of life implementation` or similar is probably a great way to start this.

### Why the Game of Life is interesting(?)
Talk about Turing machines and completeness etc.

Not super relevant to the rest of the project though, this section would be more of an aside.

### Doing all Simulation Client-Side
Talk about how a full simulation of the Game of Life might work in an entirely client-side implentation.

### Doing the Heavy-Lifting Server-Side
Talk about how having a backend server doing the actual calculation and simulation, and then just sending relevant information to the browser, might work.

Could talk a bit about different diffing algorithms, like React's [reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html).
