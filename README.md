# Game of Life â€“ Level 3 Computer Science Project
Level 3 Computer Science project at [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/computer.science/), by [Robbie Jakob-Whitworth](https://robbie.xyz). 

The details of this project are still to be decided, but may comprise the following ideas:
- Implementation and visualisation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- Consideration of performance issues of Game of Life at scale
- Being smart about rendering, e.g. only rendering changes rather than re-rendering the entire visualisation on each iteration (a bit like [how React uses diffing algorithms](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html))
- An appreciation of the fact that the Game of Life is Turing complete
