# Game of Life
**Level 3 Computer Science project at [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/computer.science/), by [Robbie Jakob-Whitworth](https://robbie.xyz).**

This project is about investigating different techniques for visualising and simulating [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

For further details about objectives, deliverables, and the research question, see the [Project Plan](Documents/Source/Project%20Plan.md).

## Quick Start
Currently working on implementation #1, simple `<div>`s.

Deploy previews are managed using Netlify.

## Documents
Relevant documents are stored in both formats in this repository:
- An editable source
- A final, published PDF

Editable documents are stored in [Documents/Source](Documents/Source).

Final, published files are stored in [Documents/Final](Documents/Final).

Relevant documents are as follows:


|File        |Editable File        |Published File       |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|Project Plan |[Project Plan.md](Documents/Source/Project%20Plan.md) |[Project Plan.pdf](Documents/Final/Project%20Plan.pdf)|

### Converting a Document from GitHub-Flavoured Markdown to PDF
The following slightly convoluted steps produce a clean PDF from a GitHub-flavoured markdown file.

1. Open the markdown file in [Atom](https://atom.io/), a free text editor.
2. Once in Atom, open a preview of the markdown file by pressing `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`M`.
    > This is the same key combination on both Windows and macOS.
3. With the focus on the preview window, save the preview as an HTML file.
    > `âŒ˜`+`Shift`+`S`
4. Open the saved HTML file in Google Chrome, and use its `Save as PDF` feature.
    > Set the scale to `70%` for optimum, consistent visual results.

### Meeting Notes
For each meeting with the supervisor, copy the file [Documents/Meeting Notes/TEMPLATE.md](Documents/Meeting%20Notes/TEMPLATE.md) and save it as a new file, with the date of the meeting in ISO8601 format (e.g. 2019-12-25).

Meeting notes can be found in the [Documents/Meeting Notes](Documents/Meeting%20Notes) directory.
